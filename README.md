# Thought Guidance

This repository contains the **anonymous implementation** of our paper  
**"Thought Guidance: Steering Reasoning Models Toward More Expert and Precise Thinking"**,  
submitted to a top-tier computer science conference in 2025.

## ðŸ§  Overview

We propose a novel prompting technique for reasoning models, called **Thought Guidance**, which dynamically inserts guidance tokens during the generation process. By steering the reasoning trajectory, our method enables the model to produce more **expert-like** and **precise** thinking paths, ultimately improving its performance on complex reasoning tasks.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Dynamic Prompt Injection** during generation via `vLLM`
- Supports **instruction tuning-style** prompts and **case-based guidance**
- Compatible with **OpenAI-style** and **LLaMA-style** reasoning models

## ðŸ“¦ Environment Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://anonymous_link_to_repo.git
